**Take-home assessment**

The assessment is designed to evaluate how effectively you can do research and problem-solving using modern tools, while maintaining good technical practice in coding, version control, and writing.

You may use modern tools, including AI-based tools, search tools, and coding assistants. However, you are expected to exercise judgement, verify the correctness of your work, and ensure that your final submission is reproducible, understandable, and technically sound.

This assessment values both quality and speed. We are interested in how effectively you can reach a sound, well-justified solution within realistic time constraints.

## Before the test

Before the test, please prepare a git repository from a previous project that demonstrates your use of version control in practice. Please ensure that it is something you are permitted to share and that it does not contain confidential, proprietary, or sensitive material.

## Instructions

Please create a new git repository for this test before starting Task 1, and use good version control practice throughout the assessment.

Your submission should include:
- a Markdown file containing a link to the final git repository, with access granted to `chen.chen@nesa.nsw.edu.au`, and briefly describing the structure of the submission, how to run any code, and how you consolidated the repositories;
- a single final git repository containing the work completed during this test;
- the pre-existing repository you prepared before the test, incorporated into the final repository in a way that preserves the relevant history of both repositories;
- the technical writing sample already prepared before the test, included in the final repository.

If you use modern tools during the assessment, include a complete log in the repository describing what tools you used, when you used them, what prompts or queries you issued where practical, what outputs they produced in summary. The purpose of this log is not to discourage tool use, but to help us assess your judgement, workflow, and verification practices.

**Timely submission** is part of the assessment. Please submit as soon as you have completed the work.

## Tasks

**1.** Let $X$ be a complex torus of dimension $17$ that contains an abelian variety of dimension $10$. Recall that the algebraic dimension of $X$ is the transcendence degree of the field of meromorphic functions of $X$ over $\mathbb{C}$. What is the smallest possible value of the algebraic dimension of $X$?

The following paper may be helpful for Task 1:
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2106.10308

**2.** Using `aluminium.csv`, which contains columns `strain` and `stress`, fit a one-breakpoint Bayesian piecewise linear model to estimate the yield point of the aluminium sample. Let

$$
y_i \mid \beta_1,\beta_2,\tau,\sigma^2 \sim N(\mu_i,\sigma^2),
$$

where

$$
\mu_i =
\begin{cases}
\beta_1 x_i, & x_i \le \tau,\\
\beta_1 \tau + \beta_2 (x_i-\tau), & x_i > \tau,
\end{cases}
$$

so that the two lines meet continuously at the breakpoint $\tau$ (yield point). Assume independent priors

$$
\beta_j \mid \sigma^2,\tau \sim N(30000,\,20000^2 \sigma^2), \qquad j=1,2,
$$

a discrete uniform prior on $\tau$ over the candidate breakpoints, and

$$
\sigma^2 \mid \tau \sim \mathrm{Inverse\text{-}Gamma}(4,\,13.12).
$$

Report posterior summaries, including the estimated yield point (breakpoint) by producing a plot of the observed stress-strain data together with the fitted posterior mean curve. If time permits, build a small Shiny app that allows the user to vary the prior settings and explore how the fitted curve, posterior summaries, and estimated yield point change.

In your solution, explain how you approached the implementation of the model and how that approach would change if the dataset were much larger or if the number of candidate breakpoints increased substantially (in gigabytes). Discuss the main trade-offs you would consider.

**3.** Consolidate the repository created for this test with the repository you prepared before the test into a single final repository, in a way that preserves the relevant history of both repositories. Briefly explain the workflow you used

**4.** Include your technical writing sample in the submission, together with a short note explaining its context, your role in writing it, and the intended audience.

## What we will be looking for

We will assess:
- correctness and depth of reasoning;
- quality and clarity of code;
- reproducibility and organisation of the submission;
- use of version control in a thoughtful and professional manner;
- quality of written communication;
- your ability to use modern tools effectively while maintaining critical judgement;
- your ability to work efficiently and make strong progress within a limited time.
